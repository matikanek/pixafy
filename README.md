# pixafy

Pixafy is a simple photo gallery application writtern in JavaScript. Images are loaded from pixabay community (https://pixabay.com/) which are sharing them for free. I used Javascript's Intersection Observer to lazy load images after scrolling page down. In the application, you can search for photos using an invented phrase entered in the input search box.
